# 🧠 AI-Powered Ticketing & Automation System

This project is an intelligent, event-driven support ticketing and automation system that leverages **AI (Gemini)** for decision-making and automation. It integrates with **ExpressJS**, **MongoDB**, **JWT**, **Inngest**, and **Nodemailer (Mailtrap)** to streamline operations like ticket classification, prioritization, email notifications, and role-based access control.

## 🧠 What the AI (Gemini) Does

Gemini AI is integrated into the system to:

* 🔍 **Determine Required Skills**
  → Based on the ticket content, Gemini identifies what skills are needed to handle the issue.

* 🗂️ **Categorize the Ticket**
  → Automatically assigns the ticket to the relevant category (e.g., Bug, Feature Request, Technical Issue).

* ⚠️ **Set Priority Level**
  → Classifies tickets as Low, Medium, or High priority using smart context analysis.

* 📝 **Generate Helpful Notes**
  → Suggests summaries, responses, or steps to help agents handle the ticket faster.

---

## 📦 Core Features

* ⚙️ **Event-Driven Architecture**
  → Powered by **Inngest** to run async background tasks and workflows like ticket assignment or sending notifications.

* 🤖 **AI-Powered Decision Making**
  → Gemini AI enhances ticket handling and user support intelligence.

* 🔄 **Automated Workflows**
  → Automatically triggers actions based on events (e.g., new ticket created = auto categorization + email).

* 👥 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  → Ensures secure access based on user roles (Admin, Agent, User).

* 📧 **Email Notifications**
  → Sends important updates like ticket status or responses via Mailtrap using Nodemailer.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

JWT is used to securely authenticate users and manage sessions. All protected routes check for valid tokens before allowing access.

---

## 🧪 Development & Testing

* Mail service is set up using **Mailtrap** so that you can safely test email features.
* Environment variables are used to store sensitive keys (`.env` file).

Inngest is used to recieve lots of the event and based on the type of event we can call any function 
example line we use of the function for sending mail
